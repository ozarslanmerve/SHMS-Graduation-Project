#                                      STUDENT HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Health Reporting System for Işık University Management Information Systems 
(MIS) Students is designed to facilitate efficient management of student medical records. This 
system aims to provide a centralized platform where students can submit their medical 
reports, allowing instructors to review and manage them. 
The system enables MIS students to upload medical reports, which are then reviewed 
by instructors. Instructors can approve, reject, or place reports on hold based on their 
assessment. Additionally, the system allows instructors to track the status of medical reports 
for each student, ensuring timely processing and appropriate action. With its user-friendly 
interface and streamlined workflow, the Health Reporting System enhances the management 
of student health records, promoting better student health and well-being within the university 
community.

## Key features of the system include: 
o Student Medical Report Submission: Students can easily upload their medical 
reports to the system, ensuring that all relevant medical information is securely 
stored and accessible. 
o Instructor Review and Approval: Instructors have the authority to review and 
manage student medical reports, making the process more efficient and 
transparent. 
o Automated Workflow: The system automates the workflow for managing 
medical reports, reducing the administrative burden on university staff and 
ensuring timely processing. 
o Comprehensive Reporting: Instructors can generate comprehensive reports for 
administrative purposes, allowing for better tracking and analysis of student 
health data.
