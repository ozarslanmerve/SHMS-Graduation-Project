#                                      STUDENT HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Health Reporting System for Işık University Management Information Systems 
(MIS) Students is designed to facilitate efficient management of student medical records. This 
system aims to provide a centralized platform where students can submit their medical 
reports, allowing instructors to review and manage them. 
The system enables MIS students to upload medical reports, which are then reviewed 
by instructors. Instructors can approve, reject, or place reports on hold based on their 
assessment. Additionally, the system allows instructors to track the status of medical reports 
for each student, ensuring timely processing and appropriate action. With its user-friendly 
interface and streamlined workflow, the Health Reporting System enhances the management 
of student health records, promoting better student health and well-being within the university 
community.
